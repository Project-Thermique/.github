# Project Thermique

Project Thermique is aimed to be an all-in-one solution to detect COVID-19 infected individuals entering an office or institution. It makes use of state-of-the-art thermal imaging and a fullstack application to automatically extract a person's temperatature from the region of interest, before logging them and alerting admins in case of a possible COVID infection. Being a contactless kiosk placed at an entryway, it also serves as an attendance tracker.
